                                there also exist a variety of cuts that can only
                                be classified as "vintage" or "antique" cuts. In

                                methods that are far more different from the
                                ones used today, to give diamonds their shape.

                                romance and seemed to be steeped in an old-world
                                charm. With time, diamond cutters have begun to
                                go back to these ancient techniques. In today's

                                            eras. When it comes to other shapes
                                            and their composition, round
                                            brilliant cuts are similar to the
                                            old European cut. In that they also
                                            have a circular girdle and 58
                                            facets. But, these diamonds cuts
                                            come without cutlets.

                                            With the passage of time, antique
                                            cut diamonds have become the go-to
                                            choice for even the most discerning
                                            buyers and jewelers. Their larger
                                            faceting and beautiful glow are what
                                            make them truly timeless. Better
                                            still, antique or vintage cuts are
                                            warmer in colour and environmentally
                                            conscious, making them a preferred
                                            choice for the eco-friendly buyer.
