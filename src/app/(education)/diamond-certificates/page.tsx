            "A diamond certificate or dossier is a formal document which intricately details out all the diamond's unique characteristics – like its cut, carat weight, colour and clarity. At times it may also include the diamond's finish which refers to its polish and symmetry, as well as a diamond's fluorescence. The most widely recognised and appreciated diamond grading laboratories in the world are the Gemological Institute of America and the European Gemological Laboratory.",
            "Certification by one of these labs or a lab of the same or similar repute is crucial for assurance of your diamond's quality. It also serves as a proof of your diamond's identity. These labs grade your diamonds in an unbiased format and you can rest assured that the information that is on your diamond certificate is accurate. This certificate also helps in future valuation of the diamond – for insurance or in the case of re-sale of the diamond.",

Through this certificate, you are guaranteed for a lifetime, that what is stated on your certificate is in fact what you have purchased.",
            "Do note, a grading certificate is different from an appraisal or valuation certificate. The appraisal certificate tends to be less comprehensive and places the monetary value of the stone – which relies on estimations influenced by the supply and demand of diamonds, global economic trends and more.",
